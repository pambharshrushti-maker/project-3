## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Start Quiz

Click the **Start Quiz** button to begin the quiz.

The start screen disappears and the quiz interface is displayed.

The first question appears and the timer starts from `01:00`.

---

### 2️⃣ Answer Questions

Each question contains four multiple-choice options.

Select the answer you think is correct.

The selected answer is stored so that when you move between questions, your previously selected answer remains selected.

---

### 3️⃣ Navigate Questions

Use the following buttons to navigate:

* ⬅️ Previous
* ➡️ Next
* ✅ Submit

The **Previous** button is disabled on the first question.

The **Next** button is disabled on the last question.

---

### 4️⃣ Timer

Each question has a **1-minute countdown timer**.

```text
01:00
 ↓
00:59
 ↓
00:58
 ↓
...
00:01
 ↓
00:00
```

When the timer reaches `00:00`, the application automatically moves to the next question.

The timer does not continue into negative values.

---

### 5️⃣ Submit Quiz

After completing all questions, click the **Submit** button to view the final result.

The application calculates:

* Total Questions
* Attempted Questions
* Correct Answers
* Wrong Answers
* Final Score
* Percentage
* Pass / Fail Result

---

### 6️⃣ Restart Quiz

After viewing the result, click the **Restart Quiz** button to start the quiz again.

The following values are reset:

* Question Number
* Score
* Selected Answers
* Time-Up Questions
* Timer

The quiz then starts again from the first question.

---

## 📊 Result Includes

The final result displays:

* 📌 Total Questions
* 📝 Attempted Questions
* ✅ Correct Answers
* ❌ Wrong Answers
* 🎯 Final Score
* 📈 Percentage
* 🏆 Pass / Fail Status

---

## 🎯 Quiz Result Logic

The application calculates the final percentage using:

```javascript
let percentage =
    (score / questions.length) * 100;
```

The passing criteria is **40%**.

```javascript
if (percentage >= 40) {
    result = "Pass";
} else {
    result = "Fail";
}
```

---

## 🔄 Restart Quiz Logic

When the user clicks the **Restart Quiz** button, the application resets the quiz data.

```javascript
index = 0;

score = 0;

selectedAnswers = [];

timeUpQuestions = [];

minutes = 1;

seconds = 0;
```

After resetting the values, the quiz starts again from the first question with a fresh timer.
